          <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>During my time at Performics I was tasked with creating a roadmap for a series of A/B tests from 2016 through 2019 which I also designed and built using Visual Website Optimizer (VWO) and Optimizely. All of the tests used a data-driven approach based on user research, brand guidelines and traffic data from Google Analytics. These sources were then leveraged to influence strategy and design decisions. The tests ranged in complexity from simple user interface modifications to re-designing the funnel checkout process as well as implementing a chat support platform. </p>

              <h5>Support Chat Platform Integration</h5>
            </span>
            <span className="image main"><img src={uhc2} alt="" />
              <h5>Confirmation Page Re-Design</h5>
            </span>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The individual tests had various rates of success, however average monthly revenue increased by $90,000, particulary after successful tests of the funnel and checkout pages.</p>
            <h2>Role & Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 3 years I served as lead front-end developer and user interface designer while creating the engagementâ€™s overall roadmap and strategy for individual tests. I also assisted in creating wireframes and prototypes using Axure and Figma.</p>
