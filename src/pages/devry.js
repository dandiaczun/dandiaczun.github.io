            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In 2017 DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management approached Performics about re-designing and building their website with a focus on increased conversions and a better mobile experience. Their previous site was not responsive or optimized for a mobile experience so my team and I decided a mobile first approach was absolutely necessary. Their target demographic for these pages was prospective students between the ages of 22-30 who relied heavily on their mobile devices to search for prospective schools. </p>
            <span className="image main"><img src={devry_site} alt="" /></span>
            <span className="image main"><img src={devry_wireframe} alt="" /></span>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The re-designed site saw 25% decrease in load time on mobile devices compared to the old site while the bounce rate decreased 15% from 60% to 45%. The site's copy was also re-written by Performics' in-house copy team which saw increases in SEO rankings and conversions.</p>
            <h2>Role & Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>I served as UX designer and front-end developer on this project, designing the wireframes and building the site using HTML5, CSS and Javascript, which was then integrated into DeVry's Angular app that powered their entire site.</p>
