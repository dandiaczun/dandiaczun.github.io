            <p>Another Lenovo project I worked on at Blast Radius was building a microsite to support the launch of a new generation of YOGA tablets and laptops. The site needed to demonstrate the benefits of a multi-purpose device while allowing users to explore the different product features without affecting load times or site speed. The site was designed to showcase the product's unique features and used Ashton Kutcher, a Lenovo product engineer, to demonstrate it's capabilties.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The site was launched in 58 countries across 30 operating systems and devices and saw 131,000 visitors in its first week of traffic, the most for any Lenovo product site at the time.</p>
            <h2>Role & Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>I served as the front-end developer on this project, which was built using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery.</p>
